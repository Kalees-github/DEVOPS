Cs of DevOps:

1.Continuous Development

	Continuous Development involves the iterative and incremental approach to software creation, where 
	development teams plan, code, and prepare software features in small, manageable units. This methodology 
	enables rapid feedback, early detection of issues, and swift delivery of value to end-users. It 
	integrates closely with version control systems and automation tools to streamline the development process.

		
2. Continuous Integration 

	Continuous Integration (CI) in DevOps ensures that code changes made by developers are automatically 
	built, tested, and integrated into the main codebase. This process typically involves four key stages:
	1. Source Code Management
	2. Build Process
	3. Code Quality Check

3.Continuous Testing

	Continuous Testing means testing the code automatically every time there is a change. This helps catch 
	bugs early before the app goes live. With DevOps and Agile methods, companies can use tools like Selenium 
	to test their applications automatically. These tools run tests faster and smarter than manual testing.
	Using a tool like Jenkins, we can set up the entire testing process to run automatically after every code 
	change. This saves time and reduces human errors. 

4.Continuous Deployment/ Continuous Delivery

	Continuous Deployment is the process of automatically deploying an application into the production 
	environment when it has completed testing and the build stages.

5. Continuous Monitoring

	DevOps lifecycle is incomplete if there was no Continuous Monitoring. Continuous Monitoring can be achieved 
	with the help of Prometheus and Grafana we can continuously monitor and can get notified before anything goes 
	wrong with the help of Prometheus we can gather many performance measures, including CPU and memory 
	utilization, network traffic, application response times, error rates, and others.


6.Continuous Feedback

	Continuous Feedback can increase the performance of the application and reduce bugs in the code making it 
	smooth for end users to use the application.

7.Continuous Operations 

	We will sustain the higher application uptime by implementing continuous operation, which will assist us 
	to cut down on the maintenance downtime that will negatively impact end users' experiences. More output, 
	lower manufacturing costs, and better quality control are benefits of continuous operations.
