Cs of DevOps :

1.Continuous Development

	Continuous Development involves the iterative and incremental approach to software creation, where 
	development teams plan, code, and prepare software features in small, manageable units. This 
	methodology enables rapid feedback, early detection of issues, and swift delivery of value to end-users. 

2.Continuous Integration

	Continuous Integration (CI) in DevOps ensures that code changes made by developers are automatically 
	built, tested, and integrated into the main codebase. 
	
	*Source Code Management
	*Build Process
	*Code Quality Check

3.Continuous Testing

	Continuous Testing means testing the code automatically every time there is a change. This helps catch 
	bugs early before the app goes live. With DevOps and Agile methods, companies can use tools like Selenium, 
	to test their applications automatically. These tools run tests faster and smarter than manual testing.
	Using a tool like Jenkins, we can set up the entire testing process to run automatically after every code 
	change. This saves time and reduces human errors.
	
4.Continuous Deployment/ Continuous Delivery

	Continuous Deployment is the process of automatically deploying an application into 
	the production environment when it has completed testing and the build stages.


5. Continuous Monitoring

	Applications and infrastructure are monitored in real-time for performance, errors, and security issues.

6. Continuous Feedback

	Teams get feedback from users, monitoring tools, and automated tests to improve software quickly.

7.Continuous Operations 

	Ensures that systems are always running smoothly with minimal downtime.
