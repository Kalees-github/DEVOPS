Git:	

	Git is an open-source  Version Control System  that allows developers to keep track of all the changes made
to the source code of software. It enables developers to collaborate efficiently, manage projects effectively, 
and maintain a complete history of changes.


	Working Directory  →  Initialization  →   Staging   →  Local Storage  →  GitHub


Core Concepts of Git:

1. Repositories:

	A repository (or repo) is a storage space where your project files and their history are kept. 

2. Commits:

	A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier
and includes a message describing the changes made. Commits allow you to track and review the history of your project.

3. Branches:

	Branches allow developers to work on separate tasks without affecting the main codebase.
 Main (or Master) Branch: The stable version of the project, usually production-ready.
 Feature Branch: Used for developing new features or bug fixes.

4. Merging:

	Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. It allows you to combine 
the work done in different branches and resolve any conflicts that arise.

5. Cloning:

	Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a remote repository. This copy includes all files, branches, 
and commit history.

6. Pull and Push:

	Pull: Fetches updates from the remote repository and integrates them into your local repository.
	Push: Sends your local changes to the remote repository, making them available to others.
